## Description
12_3 aks is 12 keys macropad project that i build myself. its start from struggling with open source third party keyboard firmware like QMK or TMK. I really confuse with their system because im start from nothingðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. 

Mostly QMK firmware are matrix enabled wiring layout because limitation of controller pin. So i build this thing with direct wiring and use all of 12 digital pin on Pro Micro. 

## Hardware Requirements
- 1x Arduino Pro Micro Atmega32U4
- 12x MX Style switch
- 3x Potentiometer (use any value)
- UTP Cable as you need

## Direct Pin Configuration

In this keyboard project, direct pin configuration refers to the use of microcontroller pins that are directly connected to each keyboard button without using matrix techniques. This means that each button on the keyboard has its own dedicated pin connected directly to an Arduino microcontroller pin.

The advantages of direct pin configuration include:
- **Simplicity in Programming**: Direct pin usage simplifies programming because each button has a separate pin that can be read directly using the `digitalRead()` function.
- **Readability of Configuration**: Pin configurations that are directly connected to hardware elements are easy to understand and implement in Arduino programs.

However, it's important to note that direct pin configuration is suitable for simple projects with a limited number of buttons. For more complex projects with many buttons, matrix techniques are often used to conserve the number of microcontroller pins utilized.
